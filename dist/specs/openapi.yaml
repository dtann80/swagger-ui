        Notes:
         * tap_player_controls is used when tapping resume in the MediaViewer (iOS + Android), or indicating that a user tapped to play a video in a feed (iOS only). 
         * tap_to_play_auto is Android-specific and should be used when playback begins upon entering the MediaViewer from an auto-playing feed.
